# Drone-Project Server

We need a server to save and retrieve data. This is a more or less lightweight approach to it.
Here you will find every written code by me in order to run the server and required services.

## Prerequisites:

In order to run the server and to modify the code you will need the following:
 
 - A installation of Node.js (My version is v10.16.3)
 - The Node-Package Express needs to be installed
 - Your prefered code editor (eg. Visual Studio, etc.)
